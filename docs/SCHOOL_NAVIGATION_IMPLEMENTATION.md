  | 'ALL'
  | 'READ'

    'READ', 
    'WRITE', 
    'MENU_MANAGE', 
    'SCHOOL_MANAGE',        // ‚úÖ NEW - Can view and edit schools
    'QUALITY_MANAGE', 
    'PRODUCTION_MANAGE'
  ],
  
  // ... Other roles ...
}
```

---

### 4. Permission Helper Function

/**
 * Check if user can manage schools
 */
export function canManageSchool(role: UserRole): boolean {
  return hasPermission(role, 'SCHOOL_MANAGE')
}
```

**Usage in API**:
```typescript
import { canManageSchool } from '@/lib/permissions'

// In API route handler
if (!canManageSchool(session.user.userRole)) {
  return Response.json({ error: 'Insufficient permissions' }, { status: 403 })
}
```

---

### 5. Resource Access Control

**File**: `src/hooks/use-auth.ts`

#### Added School Resource Check
```typescript
const canAccess = useCallback((resource: string): boolean => {
  // ... other checks ...
  
  switch (resource) {
    // ... other cases ...
    
    case 'school':
      hasAccess = hasRole(['SPPG_KEPALA', 'SPPG_ADMIN', 'SPPG_AHLI_GIZI'])
      break
    
    // ... other cases ...
  }
  
  return hasAccess
}, [user, isAdminUser, isSppgUser, hasRole])
```

## üîê Access Control Summary

### Who Can Access School Management?

| Role | Access Level | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **SPPG_KEPALA** | ‚úÖ Full Access | View, Create, Edit, Delete, Approve |
| **SPPG_ADMIN** | ‚úÖ Full Access | View, Create, Edit, Delete |
| **SPPG_AHLI_GIZI** | ‚úÖ Full Access | View, Create, Edit (for nutritional planning) |
| SPPG_AKUNTAN | ‚ùå No Access | - |
| SPPG_PRODUKSI_MANAGER | ‚ùå No Access | - |
| SPPG_DISTRIBUSI_MANAGER | ‚ùå No Access | - |
| SPPG_HRD_MANAGER | ‚ùå No Access | - |
| SPPG_STAFF_* | ‚ùå No Access | - |
| SPPG_VIEWER | ‚ùå No Access | - |
| DEMO_USER | ‚ùå No Access | - |

### Rationale for Permissions:

**SPPG_KEPALA (Head of SPPG)**:
- Needs full access to manage all school partnerships
- Can approve school registrations and contracts
- Overall responsibility for school relationships

**SPPG_ADMIN (Administrator)**:
- Day-to-day management of school data
- Can add new schools, update information
- Operational access for administrative tasks

**SPPG_AHLI_GIZI (Nutritionist)**:
- Needs to view school information for menu planning
- Can see student counts, age distributions, feeding schedules
- Essential for calculating portion sizes and nutritional requirements
- Can add/edit school dietary requirements and restrictions

**Why Others Don't Have Access**:
- **Accountants**: Focus on financial/procurement, don't need school data management
- **Production/Distribution Staff**: Work with existing school assignments, don't need to edit school master data
- **HRD**: Focus on employee management only
- **Staff Level**: Limited access to operational tasks only, not master data

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Navigation Visibility
- [ ] SPPG_KEPALA can see "School" in sidebar
- [ ] SPPG_ADMIN can see "School" in sidebar
- [ ] SPPG_AHLI_GIZI can see "School" in sidebar
- [ ] SPPG_AKUNTAN **cannot** see "School" in sidebar
- [ ] SPPG_STAFF_DAPUR **cannot** see "School" in sidebar

### Page Access
- [ ] Allowed roles can access `/school` (list)
- [ ] Allowed roles can access `/school/[id]` (detail)
- [ ] Allowed roles can access `/school/[id]/edit` (edit)
- [ ] Allowed roles can access `/school/new` (create)
- [ ] Disallowed roles get 403 error or redirect

### API Permission Checks
- [ ] POST `/api/sppg/schools` checks `canManageSchool`
- [ ] PUT `/api/sppg/schools/[id]` checks `canManageSchool`
- [ ] DELETE `/api/sppg/schools/[id]` checks `canManageSchool`
- [ ] GET requests allow READ permission

### Multi-tenant Security
- [ ] All queries filter by `sppgId`
- [ ] Users can only see schools in their SPPG
- [ ] Cannot access schools from other SPPGs

## üîí Security Implementation

### 1. Navigation Level
```typescript
// In SppgSidebar.tsx
{group.items.map((item) => {
  // Check resource access permissions
  if (item.resource && !canAccess(item.resource)) {
    return null  // Hide menu item if no access

### 2. Route Level (Middleware)
```typescript
// middleware.ts already handles route protection
const isSppgRoute = pathname.startsWith('/school')

if (isSppgRoute) {
  // Must have sppgId
  if (!session?.user.sppgId) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/access-denied', req.url))
  }
}
```

### 3. API Level
```typescript
// In API route
const session = await auth()

// Check role permission
if (!canManageSchool(session.user.userRole)) {
  return Response.json({ error: 'Insufficient permissions' }, { status: 403 })
}

// Check SPPG access
const sppg = await checkSppgAccess(session.user.sppgId)
if (!sppg) {
  return Response.json({ error: 'SPPG access denied' }, { status: 403 })
}
```
