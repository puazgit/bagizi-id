### 3. Integration

**File**: `src/features/sppg/distribution/execution/components/ExecutionDetail.tsx`  
**Changes**: Added import and component render with data mapping

```typescript
import { TeamInformationCard } from './TeamInformationCard'

// Added in render tree after Temperature Monitoring
<TeamInformationCard
  data={{
    driver: execution.driverId
      ? {
          id: execution.driverId,
          name: 'Sopir',
          phone: undefined,
          email: undefined,
        }
      : null,
    vehicle: execution.vehicle
      ? {
          id: execution.vehicle.id,
          vehicleName: execution.vehicle.vehicleName,
          vehiclePlate: execution.vehicle.licensePlate,
          vehicleType: execution.vehicle.vehicleType,
          capacity: execution.vehicle.capacity || undefined,
        }
      : null,
    volunteers: execution.volunteers || [],
    distributionTeam: undefined,
  }}
/>
```

**Change**: Added vehicle relation to include

```typescript
include: {
  schedule: { ... },
  vehicle: true, // ‚úÖ Added vehicle information
  deliveries: { ... },
  issues: { ... },
}
```

### 5. Type Definition Update

**File**: `src/features/sppg/distribution/execution/types/execution.types.ts`  
**Change**: Added Vehicle import and relation to ExecutionWithRelations

```typescript
import { Vehicle } from '@prisma/client'

export interface ExecutionWithRelations extends FoodDistribution {
  // ... existing fields
  vehicle: Vehicle | null // ‚úÖ Added vehicle relation
  // ... other relations
}
```

## üêõ Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: TypeScript Type Mismatch
**Problem**: `Property 'vehicle' does not exist on type 'ExecutionDetail'`  
**Root Cause**: ExecutionWithRelations interface didn't include vehicle relation  
**Resolution**: Added `vehicle: Vehicle | null` to ExecutionWithRelations interface  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### Issue 2: Vehicle Type Mapping
**Problem**: Vehicle from Prisma doesn't match VehicleInfo interface  
**Root Cause**: Missing vehiclePlate field (Prisma uses `licensePlate`)  
**Resolution**: Created mapping object to transform Prisma Vehicle to VehicleInfo  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

```typescript
vehicle: execution.vehicle
  ? {
      id: execution.vehicle.id,
      vehicleName: execution.vehicle.vehicleName,
      vehiclePlate: execution.vehicle.licensePlate, // Mapped from licensePlate
      vehicleType: execution.vehicle.vehicleType,
      capacity: execution.vehicle.capacity || undefined,
    }
  : null
```

### Issue 3: Unused Import
**Problem**: `'cn' is defined but never used` ESLint error  
**Root Cause**: Imported cn utility but not used in component  
**Resolution**: Removed unused import  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED
