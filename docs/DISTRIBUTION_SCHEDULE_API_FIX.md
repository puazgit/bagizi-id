# Distribution Schedule Page Error Fix

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Issue**: "Gagal memuat data - Internal server error" on http://localhost:3000/distribution/schedule

## Root Cause

The API endpoint `/api/sppg/distribution/schedule/route.ts` had undefined variable references causing a runtime error when the schedule list was requested.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Undefined Variable References
**Location**: Lines 98-100 in `src/app/api/sppg/distribution/schedule/route.ts`

**Error**:
```typescript
// Meal type filter
if (mealType) {  // ❌ Variable 'mealType' doesn't exist
  whereClause.mealType = mealType  // ❌ Variable 'whereClause' should be 'where'
}
```

**Problem**:
- `mealType` variable was never defined but was being checked
- `whereClause` should have been `where` (copy-paste error)
- DistributionSchedule model doesn't have a `mealType` field anyway

**Fix**:
Removed the entire invalid filter block and added a comment explaining why:

```typescript
// Meal type filter - DistributionSchedule doesn't have mealType field
// Remove this filter or map to appropriate field
```

### 2. Missing Type Cast for sortDirection
**Location**: Line 66 in `src/app/api/sppg/distribution/schedule/route.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
const sortDirection = searchParams.get('sortDirection') || 'desc'
```

**After**:
```typescript
const sortDirection = (searchParams.get('sortDirection') || 'desc') as 'asc' | 'desc'
```

**Why**: TypeScript needs to know this is specifically 'asc' or 'desc' for the Prisma orderBy clause.

### 3. Fixed Search Filter Structure
**Location**: Lines 114-125 in `src/app/api/sppg/distribution/schedule/route.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
if (filters.search) {
  where.OR = [
    { menuName: { contains: filters.search, mode: 'insensitive' } },
    { deliveryMethod: { contains: filters.search, mode: 'insensitive' } },
  ]
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
if (filters.search) {
  where.OR = [
    {
      menuName: {
        contains: filters.search,
        mode: 'insensitive'
      }
    },
    {
      deliveryMethod: {
        contains: filters.search,
        mode: 'insensitive'
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why**: Better formatting for readability and proper nesting structure.

## Files Modified

### `/src/app/api/sppg/distribution/schedule/route.ts`
**Changes**:
1. Removed invalid `mealType` and `whereClause` references (lines 98-100)
2. Added type cast for `sortDirection` (line 66)
3. Improved search filter structure (lines 114-125)

## Schema Verification

Confirmed `DistributionSchedule` model structure from Prisma schema:
```prisma
model DistributionSchedule {
  id                      String
  sppgId                  String
  distributionDate        DateTime
  wave                    DistributionWave
  targetCategories        BeneficiaryCategory[]
  estimatedBeneficiaries  Int
  menuName                String
  menuDescription         String?
  portionSize             Float
  totalPortions           Int
  deliveryMethod          String
  status                  String
  // ... other fields
  distribution_deliveries DistributionDelivery[] // ✅ Correct relation name
  sppg                    SPPG
  // ... other relations
}
```

**Key Points**:
- ✅ Has `menuName` field for search
- ✅ Has `deliveryMethod` field for search
- ✅ Has `distributionDate` field for sorting
- ✅ Has `wave` field for filtering
- ✅ Has `status` field for filtering
- ❌ Does NOT have `mealType` field

## Expected Result

The schedule list page at http://localhost:3000/distribution/schedule should now:
- ✅ Load without "Internal server error"
- ✅ Display schedule list correctly
- ✅ Show filters working properly
- ✅ Support search functionality
- ✅ Display proper sorting

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Navigate to http://localhost:3000/distribution/schedule
- [ ] Verify page loads without errors
- [ ] Check schedule list displays correctly
- [ ] Test status filter dropdown
- [ ] Test wave filter
- [ ] Test search functionality
- [ ] Verify sorting works (by date)
- [ ] Check pagination controls

## Notes

This was a classic case of copy-paste error where code was copied from the FoodDistribution API route (which has `mealType`) to the DistributionSchedule route (which doesn't have `mealType`). The variable names weren't properly updated causing undefined variable errors at runtime.

The fix ensures the API route only filters by fields that actually exist in the DistributionSchedule model.
