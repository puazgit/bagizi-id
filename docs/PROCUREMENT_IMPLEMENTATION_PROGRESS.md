## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions:
1. **No Mock Data** - All data from database
2. **No Hardcoded Values** - Dynamic from Prisma
3. **Enterprise-First** - Production-ready from start
4. **Multi-Tenant Safe** - sppgId filtering everywhere
5. **RBAC Enforced** - Role checks on sensitive operations

### Performance Considerations:
- Pagination on all list endpoints
- Selective field inclusion (reduce payload)
- Index-optimized queries
- Computed fields cached

### Security Measures:
- Never trust client data
- Validate everything
- Check ownership
- Log sensitive operations
- Sanitize error messages
