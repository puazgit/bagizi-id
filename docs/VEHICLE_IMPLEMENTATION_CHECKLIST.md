## Risk Assessment

### Completed Risks (‚úÖ Mitigated)
- ‚úÖ Schema complexity - Handled with 4 focused models
- ‚úÖ Relation validation - Fixed Vehicle.schedules error
- ‚úÖ Breaking changes - Avoided with DEPRECATED fields
- ‚úÖ Migration issues - Clean migration applied
- ‚úÖ Build errors - Zero TypeScript errors

### Current Risks (‚ö†Ô∏è Monitor)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data migration - Need strategy for existing vehicle data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance - 116 fields might impact query speed (add indexes)

## Quick Commands Reference

### Development
```bash
# Validate schema
npx prisma validate

# Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate

# Create migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name

# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Open Prisma Studio
npx prisma studio

# Build Next.js
npm run build

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

### Vehicle Queries (for testing)
```typescript
// List all vehicles for SPPG
await db.vehicle.findMany({
  where: { sppgId: session.user.sppgId }
})

// Get vehicle with full details
await db.vehicle.findUnique({
  where: { id: vehicleId },
  include: {
    maintenanceRecords: true,
    fuelRecords: true,
    assignments: true,
    distributions: true
  }
})

// Create vehicle
await db.vehicle.create({
  data: {
    sppgId: session.user.sppgId,
    vehicleName: "Mobil Box 1",
    vehicleType: "BOX_CAR",
    licensePlate: "B 1234 ABC",
    vehicleStatus: "ACTIVE",
    ownership: "OWNED",
    // ... other fields
  }
})
```

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Start Phase 2: API Development**
   - Create vehicle CRUD endpoints
   - Implement authentication checks
   - Add Zod validation
   - Test with Postman/Thunder Client

2. **Create Seed Data** (Optional but recommended)
   ```typescript
   // prisma/seeds/vehicle-seed.ts
   // Populate sample vehicles for each SPPG
   ```

3. **Update Distribution Form**
   - Replace manual vehicle plate input
   - Add VehicleSelector dropdown component
   - Link selected vehicle to distribution

4. **Create Vehicle Management Nav Link**
   ```typescript
   // Add to SPPG sidebar navigation
   {
     title: "Fleet Management",
     href: "/fleet",
     icon: TruckIcon
   }
   ```
