## üîÑ Model Updates & Integration

### 1. FoodDistribution Model Updates

**Location**: Lines 3219-3293 in schema.prisma

**Added Fields**:
```prisma
// New vehicle relation (preferred)
vehicleId String? @db.Uuid // Link to Vehicle model

// DEPRECATED: Old vehicle fields (kept for backward compatibility)
vehiclePlate String? // [DEPRECATED] Use vehicle.vehiclePlate
vehicleDriver String? // [DEPRECATED] Use vehicle.currentDriverName
vehicleType String? // [DEPRECATED] Use vehicle.vehicleType
```

**Added Relations**:
```prisma
vehicle            Vehicle?             @relation("DistributionVehicle", fields: [vehicleId], references: [id])
vehicleAssignments VehicleAssignment[]
```

**Migration Strategy**:
- Existing `vehiclePlate`, `vehicleDriver`, `vehicleType` fields retained
- Marked as `[DEPRECATED]` in comments
- New distributions should use `vehicleId` relation
- Old fields will be phased out in future version

### 2. DistributionSchedule Model Updates

**Location**: Lines 5343-5382 in schema.prisma

**Added Relations**:
```prisma
vehicleAssignments VehicleAssignment[]
```

**Connection Pattern**:
- DistributionSchedule ‚Üí VehicleAssignment ‚Üí Vehicle (many-to-many)
- Allows multiple vehicles per schedule
- Tracks individual vehicle performance per route

### 3. SPPG Model Updates

**Location**: Lines 1302-1471 in schema.prisma

**Added Relations** (after Menu Planning Relations):
```prisma
// Vehicle & Fleet Management Relations
vehicles             Vehicle[]
vehicleMaintenance   VehicleMaintenance[]
vehicleFuelRecords   VehicleFuelRecord[]
vehicleAssignments   VehicleAssignment[]
```

**Multi-Tenant Design**:
- All vehicle models cascade delete when SPPG deleted
- Complete data isolation per SPPG
- No cross-tenant vehicle sharing

## üîÑ Migration Path for Existing Data

### Phase 1: Data Extraction (Optional)

If you want to migrate existing vehicle data from `FoodDistribution`:

```sql
-- Extract unique vehicles from existing distributions
SELECT DISTINCT 
  vehicle_plate,
  vehicle_type,
  vehicle_driver
FROM food_distributions
WHERE vehicle_plate IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY vehicle_plate;
```

### Phase 2: Vehicle Creation (Optional)

Create `Vehicle` records from extracted data:

```typescript
// Example seed script
const existingVehicles = await db.foodDistribution.findMany({
  where: { vehiclePlate: { not: null } },
  distinct: ['vehiclePlate'],
  select: {
    vehiclePlate: true,
    vehicleType: true,
    vehicleDriver: true,
    sppgId: true
  }
})

for (const veh of existingVehicles) {
  await db.vehicle.create({
    data: {
      sppgId: veh.sppgId,
      vehicleCode: generateVehicleCode(),
      vehiclePlate: veh.vehiclePlate,
      vehicleName: `${veh.vehicleType} - ${veh.vehiclePlate}`,
      vehicleType: mapOldTypeToEnum(veh.vehicleType),
      vehicleStatus: 'ACTIVE',
      currentDriverName: veh.vehicleDriver,
      // ... other fields with sensible defaults
    }
  })
}
```

### Phase 3: Link Distributions (Optional)

Update existing distributions to use new vehicle relations:

```sql
-- Link food_distributions to vehicles table
UPDATE food_distributions fd
SET vehicle_id = v.id
FROM vehicles v
WHERE fd.vehicle_plate = v.vehicle_plate
  AND fd.sppg_id = v.sppg_id
  AND fd.vehicle_plate IS NOT NULL;
```

### Phase 4: Deprecation (Future)

After all SPPG transitions to new vehicle system:
- Remove `vehiclePlate`, `vehicleDriver`, `vehicleType` from `FoodDistribution`
- This will be a breaking change (requires major version bump)
- Timeline: 6-12 months after implementation

---

## üöÄ Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. **Create Vehicle Seed Data**
   ```bash
   # Create prisma/seeds/vehicle-seed.ts

   src/app/api/sppg/vehicles/[id]/fuel-records/route.ts
   src/app/api/sppg/vehicles/[id]/assignments/route.ts
   ```

3. **Create Zod Schemas**
   ```typescript
   src/features/sppg/fleet/schemas/vehicleSchema.ts
   src/features/sppg/fleet/schemas/maintenanceSchema.ts
