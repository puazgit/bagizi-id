# School Navigation Implementation - Final Summary

## 🎉 Implementation Complete!

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION READY

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ Navigation Menu Item
- **Location**: Program Management section
- **Position**: Below "Program" menu
- **Icon**: 🏫 School (from lucide-react)
- **Link**: `/school`
- **Badge**: None (can add later for active schools count)

### 2. ✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### Who Can Access School Management:
```typescript
✅ SPPG_KEPALA         // Full access (view, create, edit, delete, approve)
✅ SPPG_ADMIN          // Full access (view, create, edit, delete)
✅ SPPG_AHLI_GIZI      // Full access (essential for nutrition planning)
❌ SPPG_AKUNTAN        // No access
❌ SPPG_*_MANAGER      // No access
❌ SPPG_STAFF_*        // No access
❌ SPPG_VIEWER         // No access
```

### 3. ✅ Permission System

#### New Permission Type: `SCHOOL_MANAGE`
```typescript
// Added to PermissionType enum
export type PermissionType =
  | 'ALL'
  | 'READ'
  | 'WRITE'
  | 'DELETE'
  | 'APPROVE'
  | 'MENU_MANAGE'
  | 'SCHOOL_MANAGE'      // ✅ NEW
  | 'PROCUREMENT_MANAGE'
  // ... other permissions
```

#### New Helper Function: `canManageSchool()`
```typescript
/**
 * Check if user can manage schools
 * @param role - User role
 * @returns boolean
 */
export function canManageSchool(role: UserRole): boolean {
  return hasPermission(role, 'SCHOOL_MANAGE')
}
```

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
// In API route
import { canManageSchool } from '@/lib/permissions'

if (!canManageSchool(session.user.userRole)) {
  return Response.json({ error: 'Forbidden' }, { status: 403 })
}
```

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Multi-Layer Security

#### Layer 1: Navigation (UI Level)
```typescript
// Auto-hides menu item if user doesn't have access
{group.items.map((item) => {
  if (item.resource && !canAccess(item.resource)) {
    return null  // Menu item not rendered
  }
  // ... render menu item
})}
```

#### Layer 2: Route Protection (Middleware)
```typescript
// middleware.ts (already implemented)
const isSppgRoute = pathname.startsWith('/school')

if (isSppgRoute && !session?.user.sppgId) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/access-denied', req.url))
}
```

#### Layer 3: API Permission Check
```typescript
// Example: POST /api/sppg/schools
const session = await auth()

// Check permission
if (!canManageSchool(session.user.userRole)) {
  return Response.json({ error: 'Forbidden' }, { status: 403 })
}

// Check SPPG access
const sppg = await checkSppgAccess(session.user.sppgId)
if (!sppg) {
  return Response.json({ error: 'SPPG access denied' }, { status: 403 })
}
```

#### Layer 4: Database Query Filtering
```typescript
// Always filter by sppgId
const schools = await db.schoolMaster.findMany({
  where: {
    sppgId: session.user.sppgId  // MANDATORY!
  }
})
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Always Check Permissions
```typescript
// ✅ DO
if (!canManageSchool(user.userRole)) {
  throw new Error('Insufficient permissions')
}

// ❌ DON'T
// Assume user has access without checking
```

### 2. Filter by sppgId
```typescript
// ✅ DO
const schools = await db.schoolMaster.findMany({
  where: { sppgId: session.user.sppgId }
})

// ❌ DON'T
const schools = await db.schoolMaster.findMany()
// This exposes all schools from all SPPGs!
```

### 3. Use Helper Functions
```typescript
// ✅ DO
import { canManageSchool } from '@/lib/permissions'
const hasAccess = canManageSchool(userRole)

// ❌ DON'T
const hasAccess = ['SPPG_KEPALA', 'SPPG_ADMIN'].includes(userRole)
// Hard-coded role checks are error-prone
```

### 4. Consistent Resource Naming
```typescript
// ✅ DO
canAccess('school')     // Use lowercase
resource: 'school'      // Consistent naming

// ❌ DON'T
canAccess('School')     // Inconsistent casing
canAccess('schools')    // Plural vs singular confusion
```
