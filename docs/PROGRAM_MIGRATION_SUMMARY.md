- ✅ Executive summary with migration benefits
- ✅ Breaking changes documentation
- ✅ Migration checklist (4 phases)

## 🎯 Migration Benefits Realized

### 1. Auto-Generated Codes
```typescript
// Before: Manual entry (risk of duplicates)
POST /api/sppg/programs
{
  "programCode": "PROG-001", // User provides
  "name": "Program Gizi 2025"
}

// After: Server-generated (guaranteed unique)
POST /api/sppg/program
{
  "name": "Program Gizi 2025"
  // programCode auto-generated: "PROG-SPPG-JKT-001-89234567-A4B2"
}
```

### 2. Centralized Validation
```typescript
// Before: 250+ lines of inline validation per endpoint
const nutritionProgramCreateSchema = z.object({...})

// After: Import from centralized schemas
import { createProgramSchema } from '@/features/sppg/program/schemas'
```

### 3. Enterprise Response Format
```typescript
// Before: Direct data return
programs: Program[]

// After: Consistent wrapper
{
  success: true,
  data: Program[],
  error?: string
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Menu domain: Program selection works
- [ ] Production domain: Program/menu dropdowns work
- [ ] Create new program (verify auto-generated code format)
- [ ] Update existing program
- [ ] Delete program (SPPG_KEPALA permission check)
- [ ] Filter programs (status, type, targetGroup, search)
- [ ] Get program with stats (includeStats query param)
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation (cannot access other SPPG programs)

### Automated Testing Required
- [ ] Update E2E tests to use `/program` endpoint
- [ ] Update integration tests
- [ ] Update API documentation/Swagger specs
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm run test`
- [ ] Run E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e`

### Monitoring Required
- [ ] Set up alerts for `/programs` endpoint usage
- [ ] Monitor error rates on new endpoint
- [ ] Track API response times
- [ ] Verify zero calls to deprecated endpoint after migration

## 📋 Next Actions

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ Deploy changes to development environment
2. ⏳ Run manual testing checklist
3. ⏳ Update E2E tests
4. ⏳ Notify QA team for testing

### Short-term (This Week)
1. ⏳ Monitor deprecated endpoint usage (should be zero)
2. ⏳ Update API documentation
3. ⏳ Communicate migration to stakeholders
4. ⏳ Create monitoring dashboard

### Medium-term (This Month)

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered, rollback is straightforward:

### Step 1: Revert API Client Changes
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

### Step 2: Remove Deprecation Warnings
```bash
# Comment out deprecation warnings
# Both endpoints will work normally
```

### Step 3: Investigate & Fix
```bash
# Analyze issue
# Fix in new endpoint
# Re-run migration
```

**Note**: Old endpoint remains functional during entire grace period, so rollback risk is minimal.
