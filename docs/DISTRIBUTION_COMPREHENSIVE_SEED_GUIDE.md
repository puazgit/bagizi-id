## üîß How to Use

### 1. Update master seed file

**File**: `prisma/seed.ts`

```typescript
// Replace the import:
// import { seedDistribution } from './seeds/distribution-seed'

// With comprehensive version:
import { seedDistributionComprehensive } from './seeds/distribution-comprehensive-seed'

// Then in main() function, replace:
// await seedDistribution(prisma, sppgs, programs)

// With:
await seedDistributionComprehensive(prisma, sppgs, programs)
```

### 2. Run the seed

```bash
# Reset database and seed everything
npx prisma db seed

# Or use npm script
npm run db:seed

# Or use make command
make db-seed
```

### 3. Verify the data

```bash
# Open Prisma Studio
npx prisma studio

# Check tables:
# - DistributionSchedule (should have 4 records)
# - FoodDistribution (should have 5 records)
# - DistributionDelivery (should have 3+ records)
# - VehicleAssignment (should have 2+ records)
# - DeliveryPhoto (should have 3+ records)
# - DeliveryTracking (should have 8+ records)

## üîç What to Test

### Dashboard Stats
- Navigate to `/distribution`
- Verify "Quick Access" cards show correct counts
- Verify stats match seeded data

### Schedule Management (PHASE 1)
- Navigate to `/distribution/schedule`
- Should see 4 schedules with different statuses
- Test filtering by wave, status, date

### Execution Management (PHASE 2)
- Navigate to `/distribution/execution`
- Should see 5 distributions with lifecycle states
- Test status progression workflows

### GPS Tracking (PHASE 3)
- Navigate to `/distribution/delivery`
- Should see deliveries with GPS coordinates
- Test real-time GPS tracking map
- Verify route trail shows correct path

### Photos & Issues
- Open completed delivery details
- Should see 3 photos with captions
- Should see any reported issues
- Verify photo metadata (location, timestamp)

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: "SPPG Purwakarta not found"
**Solution**: Make sure to run full seed, not just distribution seed. The master seed creates SPPG first.

### Issue: "No programs found"
**Solution**: Ensure menu seed runs before distribution seed. Check `prisma/seed.ts` execution order.

### Issue: "No schools found"
**Solution**: Ensure school-seed.ts creates SchoolBeneficiary records. Check if schools-seed runs before distribution-seed.

### Issue: "No vehicles found"
**Solution**: Check if vehicle-seed or hrd-seed creates Vehicle records for SPPG Purwakarta.
